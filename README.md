#  CigPack Dataset

This link is for a portion of the CigPack dataset, containing data on typical defects in 26 categories. Due to the overwhelming amount of data in the entire image dataset, we have only uploaded a small portion on Github. If you need it, please contact the author's email address and we will send you the link to the web disk of all the datasets.
